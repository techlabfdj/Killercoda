# Killercoda Environment Tour

The purpose of this training is to familiarize yourself with the Killercoda training environment.

## Desktop Overview

The Killercoda desktop is divided into two main sections:
- The left pane displays the scenario script.
- The right pane showcases either a terminal or Theia editor.

## Actions in the Left Pane

In the left pane, Killercoda scenario scripts offer various available actions. Some of these actions are related to the displayed text, with the primary ones being `Copy` and `Exec`.
- `Copy`: Used to copy the highlighted text to the clipboard.
- `Exec`: Used to execute the highlighted text in the current terminal.

Additional actions are provided for scenario navigation:
- `Back` button: Takes you back to the previous step.
- `Next` button: Moves you to the next step.
- `Check` button: This action initiates a background script that verifies whether the user has met the prerequisites to proceed to the next step. If all prerequisites are met, a green popup (XXX) is displayed, and the next scenario step is presented. Otherwise, an orange popup (XXX) appears, and the user remains on the current step.

At the conclusion of the scenario, three new buttons will become available:

- `Restart`: This button allows you to restart the current scenario.
- `Scenarios`: Use this button to return to the scenario page.
- `Feedback`: Feel free to click on this button if you'd like to provide feedback to the Killercoda support team.
