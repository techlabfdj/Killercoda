# Introduction

The focus of this scenario is to test the behavior of a Java application on the same host but under different deployment strategies. 

Firstly, we will deploy Java directly on the host, specifying certain parameters to observe the application's performance and behavior. 
Secondly, we will deploy the application within a container, leveraging the isolation that containerization provides. During this phase, we will also manipulate certain container parameters to understand their impact on the application. 

This approach allows us to compare and contrast the behavior of the application in different deployment contexts. The aim is to test and understand java application behavior reaching memory limit.

Additionnaly, we will also discuss about cpu limit during these different deployment contexts.
