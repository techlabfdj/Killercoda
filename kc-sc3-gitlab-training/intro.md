>If you are not familiar with the Killercoda environment, take the time to explore it through [the following training](https://killercoda.com/ytison/scenario/kc-sc0-killercoda-environment-tour)

## Prerequisites

Since we are using a Docker container and thus the Docker engine, you must have [Docker](https://www.docker.com) installed on your host.  
You also need to have [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) installed since we are describing our services in a `docker-compose.yaml` file.  

And, that's all, we are ready to start our containers. You can take a look at the [`docker-compose.yaml` file](./docker-compose.yaml) to get a better insight of the environment.  

You can now click on the Start button ...
