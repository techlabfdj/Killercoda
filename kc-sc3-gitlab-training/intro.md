## Prerequisites

Since we are using a Docker container and thus the Docker engine, you must have [Docker](https://www.docker.com) installed.  
You also need to have [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) installed since we are describing our services in a `docker-compose.yaml` file.  
That's it, we are ready to start our containers. You can take a look at the [`docker-compose.yaml` file](./docker-compose.yaml) to get a better insight of the environment.
