## Tour of Go

If you're eager to learn Go, initiate your journey with the Go Tour, an exceptional resource available online: https://go.dev/tour/.

For those who prefer an offline experience, thereâ€™s also an option to install and utilize the Go Tour locally:

`go install golang.org/x/website/tour@latest`{{exec}}

Executing this command will install a 'tour' binary in your GOPATH's bin directory, which should already be incorporated into your PATH. Once installed, the tour program can be launched offline using the simple command:

`tour`{{}}

The tour command will open a web browser, displaying a local version of the Go Tour for a seamless learning experience.

However, please note that **running the tour command locally will not be possible through the 'killercoda' environment**. The instruction provided for local installation serves as an example and a reference for those who might want to install the Go Tour on their personal systems outside of the 'killercoda' environment.
