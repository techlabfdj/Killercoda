## Tour of go

Want to learn go, start with the Go Tour available on https://go.dev/tour/.

You may also install it and use it locally:

```
go install golang.org/x/website/tour@latest
```{{exec}}

This will place a `tour` binary in your `GOPATH`'s `bin` directory which should already be in your `PATH`.

The tour program can be run offline with the following command:

```
tour
```{{exec}}

When running the `tour` program, it will open a web browser displaying your local version of the tour.
